# Django Rest Framework - Car Management API

This is a Django Rest Framework (DRF) project that provides an API to manage a list of cars. The API allows you to view, add, update, or delete car details.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
- Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv django_rest
django_rest\Scripts\activate
```
(For macOS/Linux, use `source django_rest/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.)

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Migrations
Apply database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd car_rest
    ```

2. Run the server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

3. Access the API in your browser:
    - List all cars: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/car/list](http://127.0.0.1:8000/car/list)
    - Add a new car: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/car/list](http://127.0.0.1:8000/car/list) (POST)
    - View, update, or delete a specific car (replace `{primary_key}` with the ID of the car):
      [http://127.0.0.1:8000/car/{primary_key}](http://127.0.0.1:8000/car/{primary_key})

---

## Models

### Car Model
- **File**: [`models.py`](#models)  
- **Key Features**: Represents individual cars, including name, description, price, and unique car number.

### Showroom Model
- **File**: [`models.py`](#models)  
- **Key Features**: Represents a showroom with multiple cars in its collection.

---

## Serializers

- **File**: [`serializers.py`](#serializers)
- **Custom Serializer**: The `CarSerializer` includes a dynamically computed field:
  - **`discount_price`**: Calculates the discounted price dynamically in API responses.
  - **Validation**: Includes custom validation for fields like price, car name, and car description.

### Nested Serializer Example
To link cars to showrooms, you can use a nested serializer:

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import CarList, ShowRoom

class CarSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    discount_price = serializers.SerializerMethodField()

    class Meta:
        model = CarList
        fields = "__all__"

    def get_discount_price(self, obj):
        return obj.price - 5000  # Apply a discount of 5000

    def validate_price(self, value):
        if value <= 20000.00:
            raise serializers.ValidationError("Price must be more than 20,000.")
        return value

    def validate(self, data):
        if data["car_name"] == data["car_decstr"]:
            raise serializers.ValidationError("Car name and description cannot be the same.")
        return data

class ShowroomSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    cars = CarSerializer(many=True)

    class Meta:
        model = ShowRoom
        fields = "__all__"
```

For more details on the `ShowroomSerializer` with nested `CarSerializer`, refer to the **Custom Serializer** section in [`serializers.py`](#serializers).

## Class-Based Views (CBVs)

- **File**: [`views.py`](#views)  
- **Overview**: The project uses Django Rest Frameworkâ€™s Class-Based Views (CBVs) to handle CRUD operations for cars and showrooms.

### Key Views:
1. **CarListView**: For listing and creating cars.
2. **CarDetailView**: For retrieving, updating, and deleting cars.
3. **ShowroomListView**: For listing and creating showrooms.
4. **ShowroomDetailView**: For retrieving, updating, and deleting showrooms.

Directly access the detailed implementation in the [`views.py`](#views) file.

## Difference Between Authentication and Permission

In Django Rest Framework (DRF), **authentication** and **permissions** serve distinct purposes in securing an API:

| **Aspect**         | **Authentication**                                               | **Permission**                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Confirms the identity of the user making the request.           | Determines what the authenticated user is allowed to do.      |
| **Scope**           | Deals with **who** is making the request (e.g., user login).    | Deals with **what** the user is allowed to access or modify.  |
| **Implemented By**  | **Authentication classes** in DRF (`settings.py > DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES`). | **Permission classes** in DRF (`settings.py > DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES`). |
| **Examples**        | Token-based, Session-based, or JWT-based authentication.        | Role-based access, object-level permissions, or custom rules. |
| **Configuration**   | Used to enforce user login or session validation.               | Used to restrict access to specific views or actions.         |
| **Key Methods**     | `authenticate(self, request)` in custom authentication classes. | `has_permission(self, request, view)` and `has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj)` in permission classes. |

### Key Points to Remember
- **Authentication** answers the question: *Who is this user?*  
- **Permission** answers the question: *Is this user allowed to do this action?*

- [Permissions in Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/)
