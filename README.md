To add `ModelViewSet` for your project, we will use Django Rest Framework's `ModelViewSet`, which combines the functionality of `ViewSet` and generic views. Here's how you can implement it for both `CarList` and `ShowRoom` models.

---

### **1. Update `views.py` with `ModelViewSet`**

#### `views.py`
```python
from rest_framework import viewsets
from .models import CarList, ShowRoom
from .serializers import CarSerializer, ShowroomSerializer

class CarModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    A ModelViewSet for managing CarList objects.
    Provides CRUD operations.
    """
    queryset = CarList.objects.all()
    serializer_class = CarSerializer

class ShowRoomModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    A ModelViewSet for managing ShowRoom objects.
    Provides CRUD operations.
    """
    queryset = ShowRoom.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ShowroomSerializer
```

---

### **2. Register `ModelViewSet` with Router**

Update your `urls.py` to register the new `ModelViewSet` classes using `DefaultRouter`.

#### `urls.py`
```python
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from .views import CarModelViewSet, ShowRoomModelViewSet

# Initialize the router
router = DefaultRouter()

# Register ModelViewSets with the router
router.register(r'cars', CarModelViewSet, basename='car')
router.register(r'showrooms', ShowRoomModelViewSet, basename='showroom')

# URL patterns
urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),  # Include routes managed by the router
]
```

---

### **3. Benefits of `ModelViewSet`**

Using `ModelViewSet` will automatically provide these endpoints:

#### Cars Endpoints:
- `GET /cars/` - List all cars
- `POST /cars/` - Create a new car
- `GET /cars/{id}/` - Retrieve a car by ID
- `PUT /cars/{id}/` - Update a car by ID
- `PATCH /cars/{id}/` - Partially update a car
- `DELETE /cars/{id}/` - Delete a car

#### Showrooms Endpoints:
- `GET /showrooms/` - List all showrooms
- `POST /showrooms/` - Create a new showroom
- `GET /showrooms/{id}/` - Retrieve a showroom by ID
- `PUT /showrooms/{id}/` - Update a showroom by ID
- `PATCH /showrooms/{id}/` - Partially update a showroom
- `DELETE /showrooms/{id}/` - Delete a showroom

---

### **4. Testing the Endpoints**

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
2. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to see the API root.
3. Use tools like **Postman**, **cURL**, or the DRF web interface to test the endpoints.
